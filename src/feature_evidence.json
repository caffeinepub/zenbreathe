      "featureTitle": "Update the Player breathing circle sizing so that at its maximum expansion the circle maintains a visible margin to the outer boundary: the margin must equal 5% of the circle’s maximum diameter (i.e., when fully expanded, the circle’s max diameter must be 1/1.1 ≈ 90.909% of its square container, creating the required margin). Ensure the circle never covers/touches the external border during the inhale expansion animation.",
