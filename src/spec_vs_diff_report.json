  "summary": "REQ-9 asks for Player layout changes ensuring the BreathingCircle maintains >=5vw horizontal gap from both VerticalVolumeControl slider containers and never overlaps, across screen sizes/orientations. The diff shows BreathingCircle sizing tweaks (max width) but does not provide clear evidence of Player layout enforcing 5vw margins or non-overlap; Player.tsx is truncated before relevant layout code.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-9",
      "requirement": "Update the Player screen layout so the BreathingCircle never overlaps the left/right VerticalVolumeControl sliders and always maintains at least a 5vw margin (gap) between the circle edge and each slider container on all supported screen sizes/orientations.",
      "reason": "The provided Player.tsx diff is truncated before any layout/spacing code that would guarantee a 5vw minimum horizontal gap and prevent overlap/clipping. The only explicit, visible change affecting spacing is in BreathingCircle.tsx (max-w-md), which alone does not prove the required 5vw margins relative to the slider containers.",
