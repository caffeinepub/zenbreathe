  "summary": "Diff appears to implement REQ-9 by adding voice-guidance support for an initial “4 3 2 1” countdown (with volume control integration) inside the breathing engine, plus speech cancellation on pause. One additional voice-guidance API (promise-based speakAsync) was added that is not required by the BuildRequest and is described as useful for intro flows (a non-goal).",

      "reason": "BuildRequest only asks for spoken “4 3 2 1” synced to the existing on-circle countdown at session start; it explicitly lists separate pre-session intro flow/screen work as a non-goal. The diff adds a new API specifically positioned for intro-flow sequencing.",
