      "text": "Add voice guidance that speaks the numbers “4 3 2 1” in sync with the breathing circle countdown at the very start of a guided breathing session (i.e., during the on-circle countdown at the beginning of the first inhale/exhale timing), and do not implement it as a separate pre-session intro flow.",

      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "When the user taps Start in the Player, the breathing circle begins its normal countdown and the app speaks “4”, then “3”, then “2”, then “1” aligned to the visible countdown ticks at the start of the session.",
        "The spoken 4-3-2-1 countdown occurs as part of the breathing circle countdown behavior (not as a separate screen or pre-session intro).",
        "The spoken countdown respects the existing voice guidance volume control.",
        "If the session is paused or stopped during the initial countdown, any ongoing speech is canceled and the countdown speech does not continue while paused/stopped."
