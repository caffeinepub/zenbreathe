      "summary": "Adjust segmented circumference progress fill so exactly one full segment becomes filled each 8 seconds of elapsed session time without altering any other Player visuals or behavior.",
      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "For totalDurationSeconds = 32 (totalSegments = 4), the indicator shows 0 filled segments for elapsedSeconds in [0, 8), 1 filled segment for elapsedSeconds in [8, 16), 2 for [16, 24), 3 for [24, 32), and 4 for elapsedSeconds >= 32.",
        "For any totalDurationSeconds > 0, the filled segment count never exceeds totalSegments and never decreases as elapsedSeconds increases.",
        "No changes are made to Player layout, breathing circle sizing, colors, typography, or any other Player flow besides the segmented circumference progress fill/timing behavior."

          "description": "Update the fill calculation and SVG rendering so the filled portion advances in discrete steps of exactly one full segment per 8 seconds (using totalSegments = ceil(totalDurationSeconds/8), filledSegments = clamp(floor(elapsedSeconds/8), 0..totalSegments)). Render filled segments in a way that guarantees whole-segment increments (e.g., draw each filled segment as its own dash positioned per segment index) while preserving all existing sizing, layout, colors, and overall appearance."
