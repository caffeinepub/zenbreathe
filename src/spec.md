# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Populate the Exercise Info intro paragraph for the “Equal Breathing” exercise with screenshot-style English dummy copy.

**Planned changes:**
- Update only the first intro paragraph under the “Equal Breathing” title on `/exercise-info` (the element at `/html/body/div/div/main/div/p[1]`) when `exerciseId="equal-breathing"` to contain screenshot-like dummy text in English.

**User-visible outcome:** When viewing Exercise Info for “Equal Breathing,” the intro paragraph beneath the title shows non-empty, screenshot-like English placeholder text, while all other sections and layout remain unchanged.
