# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the shared top header title text to display “ZenBreathe” across the app.

**Planned changes:**
- Change the centered title text in the shared header/layout from “Breathe” to “ZenBreathe”.
- Ensure no other header layout behavior changes (icons, spacing, route-specific behavior).

**User-visible outcome:** On all routes that use the shared header (e.g., Home, Stats, Custom, Settings, About), the header title reads “ZenBreathe”.
